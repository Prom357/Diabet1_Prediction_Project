### Aim
The aim of this project is to predict whether a patient will develop diabetes based on medical attributes such as age, gender, and various symptoms (e.g., excessive thirst, weight loss, muscle weakness). 
The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Findings
Logistic Regression: This model identified key variables influencing diabetes prediction, such as gender, polyuria, and irritability. 
It provided insights into the relationship between medical symptoms and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
Random Forest: This model showed strong performance, offering high classification accuracy with variable importance plots highlighting key predictors. 
Random Forest performed well due to its ability to capture complex relationships between features.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): The KNN model performed decently, with accuracy metrics similar to those of Logistic Regression, but it was slightly more sensitive to the distribution of data and distance metrics.

## Conclusion/Summary

All three models showed satisfactory performance in predicting diabetes, with Random Forest demonstrating the highest accuracy and interpretability.
Logistic Regression proved useful for identifying significant predictors, while KNN, though effective, required careful tuning of parameters.
The analysis highlights the importance of key symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, and irritability in diabetes prediction.
Overall, this project demonstrates the applicability of machine learning techniques for healthcare prediction tasks, with Random Forest being the most robust model for this dataset.
